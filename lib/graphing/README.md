# metrics
Finds and displays build metrics in the build server. Running `metrics.rb` will generate/update all 6 .png images.

## To-Do
1. Add a current activity box. (Where is this data?)
2. Update branch-build and pull-request-build to run `metrics.rb` (should just be 1 line in each file).
3. Make and publish a flexgrid layout to display all the images.
